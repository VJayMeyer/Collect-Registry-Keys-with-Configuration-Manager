# A repeatable mechanism for populating Configuration Manager with custom registry keys

Here are some of the immediate and obvious benefits:

- Extend Configuration Manager Inventory Definition once for custom registry value collection.

- Pin to the top of custom registry keys and immediately be able to recurse through all child keys. This is perfect for delegated environments.

- Allow different custom registry key inventory collections to different groups of devices and on different collection schedules.
